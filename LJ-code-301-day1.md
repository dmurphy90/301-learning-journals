# LEARNING JOURNAL DAY 1

Today we learned about how to do template literal notation in javascript, which is a different way to put text together instead of concatenating with a bunch of + signs. It seems like it'll be easier for long strings of text, but for shorter amounts of text doesn't seem too much easier. Then we learned how to SMACSS for CSS, which is definitely a better way of organizing everything than just having a style.css sheet or a sheet for every single page with everything on it.
