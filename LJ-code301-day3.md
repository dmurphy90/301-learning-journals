# LEARNING JOURNAL DAY 3

Today we worked on using jQuery to manipulate the dom in the lab, and then in lecture we started to go over how to use jQuery for event handling. Overall, very excited to do more in jQuery my biggest gripe with javascript is having to write line after line of code just to make 1 small thing happen with the DOM, and this completely solves that.
